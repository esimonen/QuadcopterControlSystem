We first ran code coverage on our full chip testbench. Our cmd_cfg code had a case for garbage commands that was not covered. To fix this, we created another, smaller full chip test bench, which provided a garbage value to the DUT via RemoteComm. The code coverage results after running this separate test bench gave a passing result and showed that the case for garbage commands in cmd_cfg was covered.
